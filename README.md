# About This Repo

I wanted to better learn JS and the terminal, so I decided what better way to do that than by creating a fake terminal in vanilla js. It's not an actual CLI or terminal, but it pretends to be and act like one.




## Available Commands 

`help`  : Lists all the commands that currently exist.


`clear` : Clears everything on the terminal.


`cd`    : Used to change directory.


`mkdir` : Used to creare a new folder.


`touch` : Used to create a new file.


`rmdir` : Used to remove folder.


`rm`    : Used to remove a file.


`ls`    : Lists out all the content in the current directory.
